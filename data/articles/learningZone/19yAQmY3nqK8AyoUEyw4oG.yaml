  build capabilities and capacities of staff by bringing out their peoples’ potential
  whilst removing their own interference through coaching. '
:body: "We are living in an era where:\n\n- Technology does not provide a competitive
  advantage as any new products or services can be copied by competitors within split
  seconds\n- Gen Ys & Millennials are operating in alternative ways with new values
  \n- Information is at our finger tips and the pace of business has changed - no
  one person has all the answers\n- Business is global and there is a need for greater
  inclusiveness and valuing of diversity \n- The employment contract has changed -
  individuals are now more accountable for managing their own development and career
  advancement\n\n\nIt’s clear that the traditional ‘command and control’ leadership
  style is outdated. Increasingly, the best way leaders can add value to their organisation,
  is to build capabilities and capacities of staff by bringing out their peoples’
  potential whilst removing their own interference through coaching. What differentiates
  a great leader from a good leader is their ability to solve adaptive problems instead
  of technical problems.\n\n\nCoaching works for leaders in 2 defined ways:\n\n1.
  It brings personal breakthrough to the leader\n2. It constitutes an effective leadership
  style to empower their people\n\n\n### Coaching brings personal breakthrough to
  the leader\n\nCoaching focuses on the future, fosters individual performance and
  helps executives discover their own path. In an ever-changing operating environment,
  a professional coach holds a customised thinking space for leaders to review and
  reshuffle their existing resources to maximise their strengths. Being coached also
  allows leaders to discover their blinds spots and limiting beliefs which may have
  held them back from making the impossible, possible.\n\nOne of the typical blinds
  spots of leaders is their traditional identity of being a problem solver and their
  confusion between ‘knowing from doing’. A professional coach establishes trust and
  a ‘safe zone’ for leaders to rediscover their new (and productive) identity and
  bridge the leader’s ‘knowing and doing’ with effective strategies.\n\n\n###Coaching
  is an effective and engaging leadership style\n\nAs no one person has all the answers
  nowadays, asking is more effective than telling when leading a team to deliver high
  performance. Listening and reflecting back not only builds trust and engages people,
  it also allows people to pause and make responsive decisions.\n\nEmpowerment in
  Chinese means “Authorisation and Enablement”. Coaching is a learning process during
  which the leaders co-create solutions with their team and thus, they grow together.
  Coaching prompts leaders to focus on their peoples’ strengths and activates the
  Pygmalion Effect. By doing so, it increases team members’ capabilities and capacities
  to think and to act.  \n\nAfter all, the most flexible person in thinking and behaving
  is most influential. Both being coached and the ability to coach others is a self-generated
  scheme for leaders to change with the change and to create win-win solutions during
  challenging times.\n\n\n### *Written by Leona Wan – Executive Coach, Facilitator
