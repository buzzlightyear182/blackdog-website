  ensure the designing and running of successful meetings and workshops.
:body: "A person who takes on such a role is called a __facilitator__. Kaner defines
  facilitator as follows: \n> \"A facilitator is an individual who enables groups
  and organizations to work more effectively; to collaborate and achieve synergy.
  She or he is a “content-neutral” party who by not taking sides or expressing or
  advocating a point of view during the meeting, can advocate for fair, open, and
  inclusive procedures to accomplish the group’s work. A facilitator can also be learning
  or a dialogue guide to assist a group in thinking deeply about its assumptions,
  beliefs, and values and about its systemic processes and context\" (Kaner: 2007:
  xv)\n\nSpecifically, a facilitator is used in a variety of group settings, including
  business and other organizations to describe someone whose role it is to work with
  group processes to ensure meetings run well and achieve a high degree of consensus
  - generally called \"Group Facilitators\".\n- The term facilitator is used in psychotherapy
  where the role is more to help group members become aware of the feelings they hold
  for one another (see Group psychotherapy)\n- The term facilitator is used in education
  to refer to a specifically trained adult who sits in class with a disabled, or otherwise
  needy, student to help them follow the lesson that the teacher is giving (see Disability)\n-
  The term facilitator is used to describe people engaged in the illegal trafficking
  of human beings across international borders (see Human trafficking)\n- The term
  facilitator is used to describe those individuals who arrange adoptions by attempting
  to match available children with prospective adopters\n- The term facilitator is
  used to describe someone who assists people with communication disorders to use
  communication aids with their hands. \n\n[Sample attachment PDF](//assets.contentful.com/nj3ym701go0u/3K8m27kCkUG2Q6IyMeE0e4/e625a8d7887a31880d9f4b00ed4ef7e0/Black_Dog_Team_LAOB_copy.pdf)\n"
