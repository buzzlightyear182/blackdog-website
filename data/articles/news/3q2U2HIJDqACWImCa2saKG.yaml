:title: The team behind our new website (And reasons to adore working with Gen Y)
:slug: the-team-behind-our-new-website
:metadescription: It was with absolute pleasure that we managed to bring together
  a super talented team of bright young things to build our new website. I’d like
  to take a moment to acknowledge their wonderful, innovative contributions and introduce
  you to them all.
:body: "So as someone who is happiest thinking, playing and creating ‘out of the box’,
  I must confess I simply love working with Gen Y staff and suppliers. In the main,
  the world is still their oyster and they don’t seem to have been reeled in by the
  corporate ‘cannot’ culture that we seem to have imprisoned ourselves in. As such,
  their energy and enthusiasm to bring new ways of tackling briefs and challenges
  constantly surprises and delights me.\n\nTherefore, it was with absolute pleasure
  that here at Black Dog, we managed to bring together a super talented team of bright
  young things to build our new website. They are based quite literally, all over
  the world and I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge their wonderful, innovative
  contributions and introduce you to them all.\n\n\n![78a407 c91fdc40da6c480c9fe8829bc313532f](//images.contentful.com/nj3ym701go0u/6BXt9ovjos6mGO6K40YQU4/08c9d54a3e3de6a7370afa397d871b04/78a407_c91fdc40da6c480c9fe8829bc313532f.gif)\n_[Meggy
  Kawsek](http://www.meggykawsek.com/)_\n\nOverall __Creative Director__ for the website
  has been __Meggy Kawsek__. Meggy has done most of her work with us whilst studying
  at university in the States and she is a storyboarder and visual arts expert. Her
  interests include design, art and animation, as well as music and theatre. She enjoys
  writing and illustration and often comes up with ideas for comics, which she never
  really finds the time to produce. She reads webcomics, plays videogames and jams
  with her band in her spare time. More examples of her work can be found here: [www.meggykawsek.com/](http://www.meggykawsek.com/)\n\n\n![bernie

  Quah__ and her team from __Sketchpost__ worked on visuals for the Woof! video and
  took charge of its production, working collaboratively with Animation and Video
  Production Studio [www.sotongpotong.com](http://sotongpotong.com/) based in KL.
  She also drew the cool map and city icons for us.\n\nBernie founded __Sketch Post__,
  a graphic recording company based in Singapore, Malaysia & Hong Kong. The team listens
  to your ideas and transforms your words into hand-drawn visuals that brighten up
  presentations, brainstorms and events. Essentially, Bernie is a thinker and dreamer
  at heart. She believes that if she can visualise it, she can make it happen. Have
  a look at how SketchPost works with organisations visualising their ideas here:
