:title: The team behind our new website (And reasons to adore working with Gen Y)
:slug: the-team-behind-our-new-website
:metadescription: It was with absolute pleasure that we managed to bring together
  a super talented team of bright young things to build our new website. I’d like
  to take a moment to acknowledge their wonderful, innovative contributions and introduce
  you to them all.
:body: "So as someone who is happiest thinking, playing and creating ‘out of the box’,
  I must confess I simply love working with Gen Y staff and suppliers. In the main,
  the world is still their oyster and they don’t seem to have been reeled in by the
  corporate ‘cannot’ culture that we seem to have imprisoned ourselves in. As such,
  their energy and enthusiasm to bring new ways of tackling briefs and challenges
  constantly surprises and delights me.\n\nTherefore, it was with absolute pleasure
  that here at Black Dog, we managed to bring together a super talented team of bright
  young things to build our new website. They are based quite literally, all over
  the world and I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge their wonderful, innovative
  contributions and introduce you to them all.\n\n\n![meggy kawsek](//images.contentful.com/nj3ym701go0u/1mb6bzUER2c8kOW8Qaw4wK/61660f0ba6419efc47c20dde5f1e3a4e/meggy_kawsek.jpg)\n<em><a

  Director__ for the website has been __Meggy Kawsek__. Meggy has done most of her
  work with us whilst studying at university in the States and she is a storyboarder
  and visual arts expert. Her interests include design, art and animation, as well
  as music and theatre. She enjoys writing and illustration and often comes up with
  ideas for comics, which she never really finds the time to produce. She reads webcomics,
  plays videogames and jams with her band in her spare time. More examples of her
  work can be found here: <a href='http://meggykawsek.com' target='_blank'>meggykawsek.com</a>\n\n\n![bernie

  Quah_\n\n__Bernie Quah__ and her team from __Sketchpost__ worked on visuals for
  the Woof! video and took charge of its production, working collaboratively with
  Animation and Video Production Studio <a href='http://sotongpotong.com' target='_blank'>sotongpotong.com</a>
  based in KL. She also drew the cool map and city icons for us.\n\n\n![sketchpost-logo-for-sponsor-black-background](//images.contentful.com/nj3ym701go0u/4YyzvDwGE0aCkei2oUQOqa/4b5a5434273499258c244a97984dac75/sketchpost-logo-for-sponsor-black-background.png)<em><a

  __Sketch Post__, a graphic recording company based in Singapore, Malaysia & Hong
  Kong. The team listens to your ideas and transforms your words into hand-drawn visuals
  that brighten up presentations, brainstorms and events. Essentially, Bernie is a
  thinker and dreamer at heart. She believes that if she can visualise it, she can
  make it happen. Have a look at how SketchPost works with organisations visualising

  on web design and web development. Currently she works freelance with ‘Ruby on Rails’
  together with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Ruby, Rails, Git, TDD, Agile methodologies.
  She loves bending her considerable brain around new projects and we’ve really enjoyed

  we’ll be adding to the ‘news’ and ‘learning zone’ sections from time to time so
  check back for our latest updates. And don’t forget to look at our ‘WOOF’ video
  (you can find that in the navigation bar).\n\nWarm wishes,<br>\nSally\n\n*Written
