:body: "Most of you know that at Christmas 2015, Black Dog decided to sponsor a guide
  dog in Hong Kong as part of our ongoing commitment to our community here in Asia
  Pacific.\n\n‘Charlie’ came from New Zealand to Hong Kong Guide Dogs for the Blind
  and she entered her puppy training with her new foster family.\n\nWe
  were delighted to meet Charlie in person and are grateful to her foster ‘Mum and
  Dad’ for bringing her in to meet the Black Dog team. Indeed, going into an office
  environment will ultimately be part of her daily life if her training is successful
  – she certainly made everyone in our building smile!\n\nWe will keep you updated
  on Charlie’s progress – we have fingers and paws crossed that she graduates from
  puppy training to be a successful guide dog soon, so a visually impaired person
  in HK can benefit from the enhanced mobility, safety and companionship that a guide
  dog can provide. \n\nIf you’d like to know more about the work which Hong Kong Guide
  Dogs Association does, then please contact them directly on:\n\n香港導盲犬協會 Hong Kong
