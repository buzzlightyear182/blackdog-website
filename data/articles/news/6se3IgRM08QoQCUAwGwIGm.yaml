:metadescription: We've been changing things around and shaking things up at Black
  Dog. We welcome Robert Chan, a new website and logo and a brand new team dedicated
  to our customers. Have a look to see what's new in July!
:body: "Most of you will know that last week we celebrated our 8th birthday at Black
  Dog. What a milestone! And at these milestones, we think it’s important to check
  in with industry friends, customers and our team and make sure we’re doing the right
  thing by them and we’re fulfilling our promise of excellence.\n\nAs usual, we had
  some great feedback. Our website, whilst considered still fairly unique, needed
  a refresh (so we did that) and whilst we were at it, we gave our logo a makeover
  too. We think our new look reflects our brand personality well – we’d love to hear
  what you thoughts are. Check out [www.blackdog-consultants.com](https://www.blackdog-consultants.com)
  - oh and don’t forget to look for the secret video. *Hint – look for ‘WOOF’. *\n\nFinally
  and most importantly, we have responded to our clients’ request for more interaction
  with them, to help them proactively deal with the increasingly tough challenges
  they face in both learning and development and in HR. \n\nTo facilitate this, we’ve
  done two critical things. Firstly, we have increased our office headcount and second,
  we have created a new ‘Client Solutions Team’ whose remit to is to up the level
  of individual attention we can offer our clients.\n\nSo now in this newly formed
  team, Dawn Isaac, our Business Operations Manager moves across to head up two of
  our biggest accounts. Alongside her, we welcome a new pack member – Robert Chan.
  Tri-lingual and British-born Chinese, Robert specialises in helping people do business
  in China – and that is exactly what we’ve hired him to do for us as our business
  there goes from strength to strength. \n\nFinally Heice Yau, previously our Office
  Co-ordinator extraordinaire, also moves across and expands her role taking on her
  own new challenges.\n\nIn other news, we have welcomed several new facilitators
  and coaches to the team over the past few months, located in the Philippines, India,
  Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and Malaysia – and they are all looking forward
  to working with you.\n"
