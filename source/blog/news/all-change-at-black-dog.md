Most of you will know that last week we celebrated our 8th birthday at Black Dog. What a milestone! And at these milestones, we think it’s important to check in with industry friends, customers and our team and make sure we’re doing the right thing by them and we’re fulfilling our promise of excellence.

As usual, we had some great feedback. Our website, whilst considered still fairly unique, needed a refresh (so we did that) and whilst we were at it, we gave our logo a makeover too. We think our new look reflects our brand personality well – we’d love to hear what you thoughts are. Check out [www.blackdog-consultants.com](www.blackdog-consultants.com) - oh and don’t forget to look for the secret video. \*Hint – look for ‘WOOF’. \*

Finally and most importantly, we have responded to our clients’ request for more interaction with them, to help them proactively deal with the increasingly tough challenges they face in both learning and development and in HR.

To facilitate this, we’ve done two critical things. Firstly, we have increased our office headcount and second, we have created a new ‘Client Solutions Team’ whose remit to is to up the level of individual attention we can offer our clients.

So now in this newly formed team, Dawn Isaac, our Business Operations Manager moves across to head up two of our biggest accounts. Alongside her, we welcome a new pack member – Robert Chan. Tri-lingual and British-born Chinese, Robert specialises in helping people do business in China – and that is exactly what we’ve hired him to do for us as our business there goes from strength to strength.

Finally Heice Yau, previously our Office Co-ordinator extraordinaire, also moves across and expands her role taking on her own new challenges.

In other news, we have welcomed several new facilitators and coaches to the team over the past few months, located in the Philippines, India, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and Malaysia – and they are all looking forward to working with you.
