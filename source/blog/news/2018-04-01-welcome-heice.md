We’re pleased to introduce **Heice Yau** to you all. Heice joined us from a fast-paced, customer-service background and she now works in our Client Solutions Team. Heice supports the whole back office team, helping us develop and manage our key client relationships and their busy training needs.

Heice has a brilliant can-do attitude which is one of the things we love about her - plus she speaks not one, but five languages - her native Cantonese, together with top quality English and Mandarin and then some Japanese and Thai. How clever is that?

She can be contacted on [heice@blackdog-consultants.com](mailto:heice@blackdog-consultants.com) or by calling the Black Dog HQ hotline on [\+852 3689 6860](/tel:\+85236896860) and she’s looking forward to meeting you all.
