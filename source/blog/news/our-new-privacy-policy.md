This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.



**What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website or contact us requesting our services?**



When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, phone number or other details to help you with your experience.



**When do we collect information?**



We collect information from you when you register on our site, fill out a form or enter information on our site.



**How do we use your information? **



We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:

* To personalize your experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.
* To send periodic emails regarding your order or other products and services.
* To follow up with them after correspondence (live chat, email or phone inquiries)



**How do we protect your information?**

* We only provide articles and information. 
* We never ask for credit card numbers. Any payment for workshops or certifications is done by invoicing or by a 3rd party gateway provider with their own collection and security mechanisms.
* We do not use Malware Scanning.

Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, if we choose to collect sensitive information in the future, all sensitive/credit information you supply will be encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. 



We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.



All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.



**Do we use 'cookies'?**



We do not use cookies for tracking purposes

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety.   However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.



**COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)**



We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.



**CAN SPAM Act**

* Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.
