Most of you know that at Christmas 2015, Black Dog decided to sponsor a guide dog in Hong Kong as part of our ongoing commitment to our community here in Asia Pacific.

‘Charlie’ came from New Zealand to Hong Kong Guide Dogs for the Blind and she entered her puppy training with her new foster family around 8 months ago.

We were delighted to meet Charlie in person and are grateful to her foster ‘Mum and Dad’ for bringing her in to meet the Black Dog team. Indeed, going into an office environment will ultimately be part of her daily life if her training is successful – she certainly made everyone in our building smile!

We will keep you updated on Charlie’s progress – we have fingers and paws crossed that she graduates from puppy training to be a successful guide dog soon, so a visually impaired person in HK can benefit from the enhanced mobility, safety and companionship that a guide dog can provide.
