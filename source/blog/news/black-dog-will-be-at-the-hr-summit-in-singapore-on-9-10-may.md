Dear Friends, Colleagues and Trusted Partners of Black Dog around the Asia Pacific Region

As many of you know, we are celebrating our 10 year anniversary of Black Dog this year. As such, we are making it a year to remember and are happy to share that on **9-10 May 2018**, Black Dog Consultants will be powering the [**HR Summit & Expo Asia 2018 in Singapore**](http://www.hrsummit.com.sg/stream/develop-perform)

Over these two days, there will be thought provoking sessions, learning insights and sharing on the latest topics in learning and development and we are proud to announce that Sally, our Top Dog will also be providing her own insights into a couple of fascinating areas across the 2 days as follows :

**Plenary KeyNote: Wednesday 9th May @ 12pm-12.45pm (in the Develop and Perform Conference track)**

"Need Better Retention, Engagement and Performance? The Case for Making Emotional Intelligence Essential in Your Organisation"

**Power Talk: Thursday 10th May @ 10.20am-10.40am (on Power Stage 2, opposite our booth in the free to enter Expo)**
