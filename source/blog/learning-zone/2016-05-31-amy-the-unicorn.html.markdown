If you know us, you’ll know that we love TED.com

We watch TED avidly and from time to time, there’s a video which we believe it’s in everyone’s interest to watch. We’ve used this video on a number of our programmes and with one company it’s so popular that it’s asked for by name on virtually every workshop we run.

For those in the know – it’s about Amy the Unicorn. Go on, you know you’re intrigued, so grab a cuppa and watch it too. It’s both hilarious, genius and now it’s legendary. At least in Black Dog circles.
